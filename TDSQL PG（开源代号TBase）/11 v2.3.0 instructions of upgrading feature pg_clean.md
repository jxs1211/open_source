# 1. Install the pg_clean tool.

Connect any primary CN.

```
CREATE EXTENSION pg_clean;
```

# 2. Construct a use case of two-phase transaction residual.

session1—cn1

```
begin; 
create table a (id int); 
prepare transaction 'create_a';
set xc_maintenance_mode = on;
execute direct on (dn002) 'rollback prepared ''create_a''';
set xc_maintenance_mode = off;
\q
```

该用例中我们创建了一个gid为 'create_a' 的两阶段事务，然后将 xc_maintenance_mode 打开，使得该事务仅在dn002中执行rollback。

In this use case we create a two-phase transaction with gid named 'create_a' and turn on xc_maintenance_mode to make  the transaction only performs rollback in dn002.

# 3. Find residual two-phase transactions in the cluster.

session2—cn2

```
select * from pg_clean_check_txn();
```

![pg_clean_check_txn](https://github.com/Tencent/TBase/wiki/images/v.2.3.0_pg_clean_check_txn.png)

The above figure prints out the two-stage transactions remaining in the cluster. The gid indicates the global identifier of the transaction, global_transaction_status indicates the status of the transaction globally, and transaction_status_on_allnodes indicates the status of the transaction in all nodes.

# 4. view 2PC residual file names

Query all the 2PC residual file names under the data directory pg_2pc in node cn1

session1—cn1

```
	postgres=# select * from pgxc_get_record_list();
	 pgxc_get_record_list 
	----------------------
	 create_a
	(1 row)
```

# 5. Clean up residuals of two-phase transactions in the cluster.

session2—cn2

```
select * from pg_clean_execute();
```

![pg_clean_execute](https://github.com/Tencent/TBase/wiki/images/v2.3.0_pg_clean_execute.png)

The above figure prints all residual two-stage transactions and the operations performed on them. The operation indicates the operation performed on the transaction at each node, and the operation_status indicates whether the operation was performed successfully. Since the global transaction status of the transaction is ABORT, we go to each node with the status of PREPARE and perform a rollback operation on the transaction.

# 6. Check for residual documentation records of cleaned up two-stage transactions.

session1—cn1

```
	postgres=# select * from pgxc_get_record_list();
	 pgxc_get_record_list 
	----------------------
 
	(1 row)
```

由于在上个步骤pg_clean_execute执行成功，因此已经回滚的事务'create_a'在所有节点的文件记录均已删除，这里我们在cn1查看所有2pc文件记录，显示为空，结果正确。

Since pg_clean_execute was executed successfully in the previous step, the file records of the transaction 'create_a' that has been rolled back in all nodes have been deleted. Here we check all 2pc file records in cn1, which shows empty, and the result is correct.
